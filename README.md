# ViroBLAST
[ViroBLAST](https://viroblast.fredhutch.org) is a web tool to provide sequence comparison and contamination checking on viral research. 
ViroBLAST is readily useful for all research areas that require BLAST functions and is available as a downloadable archive for independent installation (current version: viroblast-2.16+). 
ViroBLAST implements the NCBI C++ Toolkit BLAST command line applications referred as the BLAST+ applications.

### Usage

With the common features of other Blast tools, the ViroBLAST provides features like:

  - Blast multiple query sequences at a time via copy-paste sequences or upload sequence fasta file.
  - Provide email option to receive the result via email.
  - Blast against user's own sequence data set besides the public databases on ViroBLAST.
  - Blast against multiple sequence databases simultaneously (Using "Command" key [Mac] or "Ctrl" key [Windows] to select multiple databases or deselect database).
  - Summarize results via tabular output and allows further analysis.
  - Download sequences in databases that match user's query sequences.
